        <h3>Why a remote conference?</h3>
        <p>Learning is an important part of improving your code. One of the most rewarding ways to do that is by attending conferences. Unfortunately, sometimes it's difficult to make it to a conference due to travel costs, the price of the conference ticket, or your ability to take time off.</p>
        <p>So, clear your calendar, grab some popcorn and twizzlers, and join us for some great content around building web and mobile apps. Or, grab a Users' Group ticket, get a company to provide a projector and pizza, and learn more realtime web development with your friends..</p>

            <span class="speaker">Derick Bailey</span>
            <p class="hide-for-small-only">In this session, then, you'll see 5 tips to help improve your JavaScript and your browser code with the latest version of the language, ES6 (aka ES2015). You'll see what it takes to run ES6 code today, and the tools you need to support the features you want in browsers that aren't yet up to date.

            <span class="speaker">Dominic Nguyen</span>
            <p class="hide-for-small-only">So you’ve wrapped your head around creating reactive interfaces. Your app feels alive with activity, but now the app has grown, and all the activity is triggering frequent unexpected UI changes. What felt alive now seems chaotic to your users. Understanding Meteor, React, or Angular is not enough. You need to design for reactivity. This talk presents three UX principles to help you master reactive systems.</p>

            <p class="hide-for-small-only">The threat of SQL injection in modern web applications has been left by the wayside with the rise of NoSQL databases. Unfortunately, a new, but fundamentally similar threat has taken its place: NoSQL injection. Let's take an in-depth look at this type of attack and the steps we can take to protect ourselves from it. The king is dead, long live the king!</p>

At Kadira, we use GraphQL as the core data layer and it's used by almost every microservice in Kadira. We also used it to power charts in Kadira UI as well. In this talk, we'll focus why we use GraphQL and the process we used migrate our services to utilize GraphQL.</p>

            <p class="hide-for-small-only">Most people lean on frameworks to iterate quickly and leverage solutions to common problems, but what happens when your framework gets deprecated…or you change your mind? Abhi is a Software Engineer at Workpop, Inc and will show you how you can build your app in different layers so you are still productive in your framework but allow flexibility for change. The inspiration for all of this came from an architectural pattern called Flux. Abhi will show you how you can build layers above your user interface, mobile applications, and server to achieve code longevity.</p>

          <span class="speaker">James Smith</span>
          <p class="hide-for-small-only">Redux and React allows you to build client applications with a single direction data flow using powerful tools like time traveling debugging. All of this comes from how Redux embraces functional programming practices. It also uses patterns that are found in Erlang/OTP and by extension Elixir. Which is why using Elixir and Phoenix as your backend system along with it makes a lot of sense. In my talk I will go over what a React / Redux app wired up to Phoenix using channels looks like and how to leveage both to build exciting interactive applications.</p>
